# 📊 **Paisabazaar Credit Score Analysis & Classification**

## 📝 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and applying **supervised machine learning** techniques to the Paisabazaar banking dataset. The aim is to understand customer credit behavior, detect influential financial factors, and **classify credit scores** into categories like *Good*, *Standard*, and *Poor* to support better loan risk assessment and financial recommendations.

---

## 📌 **Objectives**

* Perform detailed **EDA** to identify patterns and trends in customer financial attributes such as income, credit history, payment behavior, and debt.
* Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, outliers, duplicates).
* Apply **feature engineering** (e.g., debt-to-income ratio, one-hot encoding for categorical variables).
* Implement **classification models** such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc., to predict customer credit scores.
* Optimize model performance through **hyperparameter tuning** (GridSearchCV).
* Visualize **evaluation metrics** and interpret feature importance for business insights.
